Langton's Ant Audio-Visual Project Progress and Plan
================================================

Current Implementation (2024-02-21)
----------------------------------
1. Basic Langton's Ant simulation with multiple ants
2. Real-time visualization using PyQt5
3. Real-time audio generation with the following features:
   - Stereo panning based on ant positions
   - Logarithmic frequency scaling for musical intervals
   - Logarithmic amplitude scaling for natural volume progression
   - Per-ant sound generation
   - Real-time audio playback using Pygame

Recent Improvements
------------------
1. Switched from grid-based audio to ant-position-based audio
2. Implemented stereo panning for spatial audio
3. Added logarithmic scaling for both frequency and amplitude
4. Optimized audio generation for real-time performance

Future Enhancements
------------------
1. Musical Improvements:
   - Map frequencies to musical notes/scales (pentatonic, major, minor)
   - Add different waveforms per ant (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
   - Add control for number of octaves in frequency range
   - Implement ADSR envelope for smoother sound transitions
   - Add reverb/delay effects for spatial depth
   - Allow custom scale mapping through GUI

2. Visual Improvements:
   - Add color gradients based on ant movement patterns
   - Implement trail effects
   - Add visualization of audio parameters
   - Create heat maps of ant activity

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement audio buffering for smoother playback
   - Optimize grid updates for larger simulations
   - Add multi-threading for audio processing

4. User Interface:
   - Add presets for different ant rules
   - Create a more intuitive parameter mapping interface
   - Add visualization of audio parameters
   - Implement save/load functionality for configurations

5. Recording Features:
   - Add high-quality audio export
   - Implement video recording with audio
   - Add MIDI export capability
   - Create project file format for saving/loading simulations

Technical Notes
--------------
- Current audio implementation uses Pygame's sound system
- Visualization uses PyQt5 for the GUI
- Audio generation is based on ant positions rather than grid states
- Stereo panning is implemented using linear interpolation
- Frequency and amplitude use logarithmic scaling for more natural progression

Next Steps
----------
1. Implement basic musical scale mapping
2. Add waveform selection per ant
3. Improve audio buffering for smoother playback
4. Add basic effects processing
5. Create a configuration system for saving/loading settings
