Future Enhancements:
1. Trail Interactions:
   - Implement different trail interaction rules for each ant
   - Allow ants to follow their own colored trails
   - Add trail avoidance for other ants' colors
   - Create special trail types (e.g., walls, teleporters)
   - Add trail persistence/fading mechanics
   - Consider trail-based communication between ants

2. Audio Improvements:
   - Add more musical scales and modes
   - Implement chord progressions based on ant patterns
   - Add effects processing (reverb, delay, etc.)
   - Create more complex waveform combinations
   - Add rhythm generation based on ant movement patterns

3. Visual Enhancements:
   - Add trail fading effects
   - Implement color blending between different ant trails
   - Add particle effects for ant movement
   - Create more sophisticated visualization modes

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement spatial partitioning for faster ant movement
   - Add multithreading for audio processing
   - Optimize trail rendering for better performance

5. User Interface:
   - Add preset management for different ant behaviors
   - Create a pattern library for interesting ant configurations
   - Add real-time parameter modulation
   - Implement pattern recording and playback

6. Export Features:
   - Add high-quality video export
   - Implement audio export in various formats
   - Create pattern sharing functionality
   - Add configuration export/import
